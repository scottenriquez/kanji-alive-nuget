# Thanks
Special thanks to the Kanji Alive team for not only providing their kanji data in a clean, consumable format, but also for hosting a RESTful API to expose it too. Note that if you would like to include this kanji data locally in your project, you can download the language data and media directly from [this repo](https://github.com/kanjialive/data-media).
